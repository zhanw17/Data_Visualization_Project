# Data_Visualization_Project
## Introduction
The project is aim to help the BootLoader to determine user characteristics on specific project types, perform analysis on user’s preference on projects for notification delivery and predict the donation amount. 

BootLoader is a crowdfunding mobile app that helps people crowdfund their creative projects. Anyone with an idea, dream, and 2-minute video can post their project on BootLoader. Others then donate money to the project to help bring it to fruition. We were able to track user’s interactions with the mobile app and have been collecting analytics data on how the users view and fund projects. 

The purpose is to help determine what segment of users would be interested in specific project types and has the potential to fund the projects. We aim to perform analysis on user’s preference on projects, therefore the software can precisely deliver notification to segments of users, based on specific attributes and leading to more funds. We also want to initiate a model to predict the amount of donation from the users.
